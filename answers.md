1. Name two methods on the console object?
console.log - prints one or more indicated objects, concatenated as a string.
console.clear - clears everything from the console window.

2. Name three of the common types of errors in JavaScript.
*Reference error* - You reference a variable that has not been declared.
prints "ReferenceError / [var] is not defined"
*type error* - The TypeError object represents an error when a value is not of the expected type. (MDN)
*syntax error* - thrown when the JavaScript engine encounters tokens or token order that does not conform to the syntax of the language when parsing code.

3) If an exception isn't handled in a program, what happens?
An error message is printed to the console and program execution terminates. [If the program handles the error programmatically (within the program, without it terminating, it is called catching)]

4) What construct is used to handle situations where code may throw exceptions?
try/catch

Complete each exercise to the best of your ability. Follow the instructions and save your files to your week_5_lecture_1_exercises Github repository. Any short answer questions may require some additional research on your part.

Each of the following blocks of JavaScript contains errors. Take a look at each and do the following:
Identify which line the error occurs on.
Explain the cause of the error
Fix the error, so the code produces the desired response.
