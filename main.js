var firstName = 'Julia'
var lastName = 'Roberts'
var fullName = firstName + lastName
// lastName was spelled incorrectly within the fullName function,
// returning the error "lastname is not defined.
// Newline sucks.  I pressed run, it brought up "evaluating..." and never loaded.
// I moved it to arbiter, which basically gave me the answer immediately
console.log(fullName) // Julia Roberts
